comparison of multiplicative inverses for odd numbers in mod 2<sup>n</sup>

The mnv algorithms are a thing.

I assume the Euler algorithm is how it's implemented elsewhere, but I did re-create it from Euler's theorem with the totient function.

I haven't figured out the Extended Euclidian algorithm yet, so it is unimplemented.
